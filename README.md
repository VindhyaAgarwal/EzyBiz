## Getting Started ðŸš€

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
  
### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (if using a JavaScript-based frontend/backend)
- Python (if using a Python-based backend)
- Git

[Any other specific dependencies, e.g., npm, yarn, pip, Docker]

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VindhyaAgarwal/EzyBiz.git
   cd EzyBiz
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies:**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the frontend directory (if applicable)
   cd frontend/
   npm install # or yarn install
   ```
   
3. **Install Backend Dependencies:**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the backend directory (if applicable)
   cd backend/
   pip install -r requirements.txt # or npm install, etc.
   ```

4. **Database Setup:**:
   - Example for MongoDB: Ensure MongoDB is running.
   - Example for PostgreSQL:
     
   ``` bash
   # Create database
   createdb ezybiz_db
   # Run migrations (if using ORM like SQLAlchemy, Sequelize, etc.)
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory (and `frontend/` if needed) based on the provided `.env.example` (or similar) and fill in the necessary values (e.g., database connection strings, API keys, secret keys).
   - Example `.env` content:
     
   ```bash
   DB_URI=your_database_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   # Add other necessary environment variables
   ```
## Running the Environment

1. **Start the Backend Server:**:
   ```bash
   cd backend/
   npm start # or python app.py, etc.
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend Development Server:**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend/
   npm start # or yarn start
   ```
   - The application should now be accessible in your web browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your frontend configuration).
## Usage

- **Admin Panel**: Access the admin dashboard at `/admin` to manage users, roles, and system settings.
